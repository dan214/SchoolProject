This is a system that runs a simplified stochatic simulation of a basic virus and the patient it attacks. 
There are some parameters required for simulation. I have provided them for easier understanding. You may 
tweak the parameters to better understand the simulation process.
Running
Simply run main.py
These are the parameters for simulation

To include database functionality,uncomment lines 28 through to 231 in main.py. Then go to DB_manager, uncomment lines 3 to 5 and lines 82 to 86, uses mysql.connector. go to line 15 and change the username and password for your localhost.
Then go back to main.py line 1151 change 
ex = Ui_MainWindow()
to be 
ex = Ui_Login()
then run main.py 
Voila!
